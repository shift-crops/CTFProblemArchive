This program behaves like a simple memcached.
Each entry is managed in a tree structure based on the hash of the key.
(Hash conflicts are not considered)

Heap overflow
When rewriting the contents of a previously registered key, if the requested size is less than the existing size, the program uses the same area.
We use chunk size of heap to judge the size.
Since size is calculated without considering PREV_INUSE, 1 byte overflow occurs.
